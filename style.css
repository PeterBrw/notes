/* Block level elements it will take the entire width of the page by default */

#product-overview {
  background: #ff1b68;
  width: 100%;
  height: 528px;  
  padding: 10px;
  border: 5px solid black;
  margin: 10px;
  box-sizing: border-box; /* in this case the height it's 528px with border, padding and margin size, if we use the content-box value, then it will without this, just the content size itself */
}

<a></a> /* are rendering inline, it take width as much as the content needs because it's display inline by default */

/* the block elements take the entire width available  */

display: none; /* it will remove that element, it's taken out from the document flow, but it's still in the DOM, usually it's use with JavaScript for example to be show something when you click a button */

display: inline-block; /* it wil dispay a list for example in inline block level, what means that we can add border, margins and so on to them */

Here's an example for visibility: hidden :

.box-1 {
    visibility: hidden;
}

.box-2 {
    display: inline-block;
}
Will render:

_x 

where _  simply is an empty spot and x  has the class box-2 .

The element is only invisible, it's not removed from the document flow and of course also not from the DOM.


It's not really a CSS topic, though it's related to it: The difference between block-level and inline elements.

You can read a more detailed article (which also includes a YouTube video about HTML at the top of the page) here: https://academind.com/learn/html/beginner-s-guide/diving-deeper-into-html#block-level-vs-inline-elements

Here's the executive summary:

Block-level elements are rendered as a block and hence take up all the available horizontal space. You can set margin-top and margin-bottom and two block-level elements will render in two different lines.

Some examples are: <div> , <section> , <article> , <nav>  but also <h1> , <h2>  etc and <p> .

Inline elements on the other hand only take up the space they require to fit their content in. Hence two inline-elements will fit into the same line (as long as the combined content doesn't take up the entire space in which case a line break would be added).

They also use the box-model you learned about but margin-top  and margin-bottom  have no effect on the element. padding-top  and padding-bottom  also have a different effect. They don't push the adjacent content away but they will do so with the element border. You can read more about that behavior in the following article: https://hacks.mozilla.org/2015/03/understanding-inline-box-model/

Additionally, setting a width  or height  on an inline element also has no effect. The width and height is auto to take as much space as required by the content.

Logically, this makes sense since you don't want your inline elements to destroy your multi-line text-layout. If you want to do so or need both block-level and inline behavior, you can set display: inline-block  to merge behaviors.

Some example elements are: <a> , <span> , <img> 


/* When you calculate the inline-block width for some elements use width: calc(100% - 54px); 54px in this case is a little bigger cause can cause some unwanted style check Video 38 */

/* Pseudo-class defines the style of a special state of an element like hover and active element:hover {}

Pseudo-elements defines the style of a specific part of an element 
 element::first-letter {} - this allow us to style the first letter of the element */ 

.main-nav__item a::after {
